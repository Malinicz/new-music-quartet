Four outstanding instrumentalists, graduates of Polish music academies, Katarzyna Gluza (violin), Paulina Marcisz (violin), Karalina Orsik-Sauter (viola) and Dominika Szczypka (cello), have been busy giving concerts at home and abroad, popularizing chamber music, particularly, works by Polish composers.',
